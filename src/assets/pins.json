    "message": "Y'know what's sad? Mediocrity. When a man who once was passionate about baking won't admit he can crack an egg because he was told it made him look gay. Or when someone who once spoke so passionately about stars and galaxies and everything in-between now speaks of people and events because no one ever listened before. Or when someone replaces books with beer to the beach because they're too tired of being called dorky and uncool. It makes me sad when someone is quite something, until society mediocres him down."

    "message": "There are those rare moments in life when we say this. No matter how much this means to me. No matter how centered my being is on this pattern of belief. No matter how close I am personally and emotionally and even romantically to those who hold such convictions. I must reserve the right to question and to doubt. I will retain this skeptical bias as an obligation owed to my own rationality, my own integrity. I am prepared to follow the golden cord leading me out of the labyrinth no matter how many twists and turns there are because once I let go of that, my intellectual life is not my own."

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."
