# Vue.js Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for a personal website developed using Vue.js. The website was created as a learning project to explore the capabilities of this popular JavaScript framework. The website is hosted at https://soliman.life and showcases some of the skills and techniques I have learned while working with Vue.js.


``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
