# Vue.js Personal Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal website, hosted at https://soli.blue. This website serves as a space where I share my projects and experiences. It's developed using Vue.js, a popular JavaScript framework.

## About the Website

The website showcases a variety of projects I've worked on, ranging from AI applications to web development and data analysis. Each project is a testament to my passion for learning and discovery, and the joy I find in answering intriguing questions through technology.
